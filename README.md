# Decision Tree repo



Learning and testing an algorithm for generating a decision tree from mysql input. 

Decision Trees are used in data mining, machine learning and artificial intelligence to look at data and perform operation such as : 

- classifying data
- discovering hidden patterns in your data
- predicting future behaviors

This is a great video which covers most of the concepts I use in this repository :

## TODO :
- [x] add jest unit tests
- [ ] re factor sorted inputs away from inforomationGain.js and assign to a class
- [ ] create classes to store attribute map and sorted inputs
- [ ] complete recursion
